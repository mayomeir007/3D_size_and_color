A desktop application that renders a cube in 3D space. The color of the cube changes linearly with respect to its scale. You can rotate it about the 3 cartesian axes. You can also add two different kinds of textures to the surfaces of the cube. 

The color of the cube is quantified using the the formula to convert HSI to RGB. Minimum scale of the cube corresponds to Hue value of Red. Maximum scale of the cube corresponds to Hue value of Blue. The value of S and I are given a fixed value of 1.
